## Project Purpose and Overview

This project focuses on enhancing low-quality images using advanced image processing techniques such as:
- CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)
- Gamma Correction
- Denoising

The goal is to improve the quality of images and evaluate their performance by comparing the enhanced images to the corresponding high-quality ground truth images. The project calculates and logs the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) score to provide quantitative assessment of enhancement quality.

## Setup Instructions and Dependencies

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- scikit-image
- Matplotlib

### Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ELZAYDA/Image-Enhancement-Quality-Comparison.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Image-Enhancement-Quality-Comparison
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Directory Structure

The project follows this directory structure:

```
Image-Enhancement-Quality-Comparison/
â”‚ 
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                      # Contains input images
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ low/                   # Low-quality input images
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ high/                  # High-quality ground truth images
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
|   â””â”€â”€ notebook.ipynb         # Interactive Jupyter notebook        
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ results/               # Results directory
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ enhanced/          # Enhanced output images
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ plots/             # Comparison visualizations and histograms
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ metrics/           # SSIM scores and metrics logs
|
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt           # List of dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ script.py                  # Main image processing script
â””â”€â”€ README.md                  # Project documentation
```

## Usage Examples

### Input Images

This project requires two sets of images:
- **Low-quality images** (stored in the `data/low` folder)
- **High-quality ground truth images** (stored in the `data/high` folder)

**Important**: Ensure that the number of low and high-quality images are the same, and they are named consistently to allow proper matching between pairs.

### Example Command

To run the image enhancement and save results, execute the following command:

```bash
python script.py
```

### Output

The output will be saved in the `src/results/` directory:

- **Enhanced Images**: Saved in the `src/results/enhanced/` folder
- **Comparison Plots**: (Original, Enhanced, Ground Truth) saved in the `src/results/plots/` folder
- **SSIM Scores**: Logged in the `src/results/metrics/metrics.csv` file
- **Histograms**: Original, enhanced, and ground truth image histograms saved in the `src/results/plots/` folder

### Example of Input and Output

#### Input (Low-Quality Image):
<img src="/api/placeholder/400/300" alt="Low-Quality Image Example"/>

#### Output (Enhanced Image):
<img src="/api/placeholder/400/300" alt="Enhanced Image Example"/>

#### Ground Truth (High-Quality Image):
<img src="/api/placeholder/400/300" alt="Ground Truth Image Example"/>

### SSIM Score:

The Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) is calculated to measure the similarity between the enhanced and ground truth images. The SSIM score is logged for each image pair processed.

## Results and Performance Metrics

The project evaluates enhancement quality using the **Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)** between the enhanced image and the corresponding high-quality ground truth image. The SSIM scores are saved in a CSV file for further analysis.

### Example CSV log entry:
```
timestamp,image_name,ssim
2025-05-12 12:34:56,sample_low_image,0.85
2025-05-12 12:35:03,another_image,0.78
2025-05-12 12:35:10,third_image,0.92
```

### SSIM Interpretation

| SSIM Range | Quality Assessment |
|------------|---------------------|
| 0.95 - 1.00 | Excellent enhancement |
| 0.88 - 0.94 | Good enhancement |
| 0.80 - 0.87 | Acceptable enhancement |
| 0.70 - 0.79 | Moderate enhancement |
| < 0.70 | Poor enhancement |

## Enhancement Techniques

### CLAHE

Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization works by:
- Dividing the image into small tiles
- Applying histogram equalization to each tile
- Limiting contrast amplification to reduce noise
- Interpolating across tile boundaries to eliminate artifacts

### Gamma Correction

Adjusts the luminance of the image following the power-law expression:
- Output = Input^Î³
- Î³ < 1: Brightens darker regions
- Î³ > 1: Darkens brighter regions

### Denoising

Removes unwanted noise while preserving important image details using:
- Non-local means denoising
- Adaptive filtering techniques
- Edge-preserving algorithms
